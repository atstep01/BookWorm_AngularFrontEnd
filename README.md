# BookWorm_AngularFrontEnd
This is the front end application for Bookworm. Bookworm in concept is a social media website designed around books. Bookworm will allow people from all over the world to connect based on common reading interest and even allow hobbyist authors to give their writings a platform.

You can find wireframes(readable in draw.io) and Phases(Epics/Stretch Goals) under the docs folder. Feel free to submit any issues you find to the repo and I'll try to get to them ASAP. Check out what I'm doing on a closer level by checking out the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/piwnIegB/frontend#).
